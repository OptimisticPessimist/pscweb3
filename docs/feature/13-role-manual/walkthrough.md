# Walkthrough - Role-based Instruction Manual

## Changes
- Created `docs/role_manual.md`: A user instruction manual in Japanese, tailored for high school students.
- Defined three roles:
    - **Owner (管理者)**: Full access.
    - **Editor (編集者)**: Staff access (script/schedule).
    - **Viewer (閲覧者)**: Cast/Staff access (read-only info, attendance).

## Verification Results
### Manual Verification
- **Readability**: Confirmed that the language is simple and uses emoji to be approachable.
- **Accuracy**: Roles match the system definitions (`User`, `ProjectMember` roles in `models.py`).

## Next Steps
- Distribute this manual to the theater club members.
